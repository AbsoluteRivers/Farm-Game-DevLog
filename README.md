# Farm-Game-DevLog

<p>This is a DevLog for my learning steps in creating a farming game in Godot 4</p>

<hr>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>- Learned nodes, scenes, and tilemaps
- Used free assets <a href="https://cupnooble.itch.io/sprout-lands-asset-pack">SproutLands by CupNooble</a> on itch.io
- Set tilesets onto atlas manually
- Animated animations for player character and tilemap scene</p>
<br>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>- Focused in player character movement
- Learned node states and node state machine for player character movement
- Used <a href="https://github.com/rapidvectors/tutorial-components-and-scripts/tree/main/tutorials/croptails">script</a> of node state and node state machine by <a href="https://github.com/rapidvectors">rapidvectors</a>
- Provided keyboard input for movement
- <i>Included controller support</i>
- Learned how to use and debug for node states with idle and walk</p>

<br>
<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p>- Learning further player state machines for other actions
- Created script for tools. Listed object tools
- Created node states for chopping, watering, and tilling animations
<i>  *remember to turn looping in animation off*</i>
- <i>Edited walking script to allow diagonal movement using x and y axis</i>
- Provided input mapping for hit/interaction
- Added action script for interaction animation
- <i>Added cancel action script. Will check if correct usage</i>
- Learning tilesets and tilemap layers
- House scene and physics apply on tilesets
- Created 2 types of houses. Still unsure about physics layers, collision layers, and collision maps</p>
